Apoidea prototype projects based on Honey Bee
the youtube demo is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9VRmtdVZoU

This is Project prototype where the player has to move the queen bee ( red bee) anlong with the male bees ( black) ,
There will be obstacles on her way out of the tunnel.

If the queen bee slows down then she fails , she has to move with the camera speed

Level1: Status = Done: The queen bee has four male with static obstacles

level2: Status = Done: the number of male bees increase 

level3: Status = Done: the bstacles becomes dynamics 

level4: Status = TODO: the camera speed increases and user has to press D to increase  forward speed.

level5: Status = TODO: If the queen bees drinks honey on its way then she increases her speed and agility , she has to drink the hooney to gain energy

Level5: Status = TODO: On her way other apoidea comes and queen  has to avoid then else they will stick to her and size of the queen bee increase which makes 
her difficult to pass through narrow obstacles.
